ENCAPSULATION:
 -> Encapsulation in Java is a process of wrapping code and data together into a single unit
 -> We can create a fully encapsulated class in Java by making all the data members of the class private
 -> Public Method which is used to update(SET) private variable is known as "SETTER" or "MUTATOR".
 -> Public Method which is used to Read(GET) private varaiable is known as "GETTER" or "ACCESSIOR".
 -> Encapsulation can be refered as a data hiding.
 
 ADVANTAGES:
 1. A class can have full control on data members
 2. A class can make its data members either read only or read/write by providing setter(or) getter.
 3. A class can change its internal implementation without effecting users program

 Example:
   class Student{
     private int rollno;
     private String name;
     }
     public void setRollno(int rollno){
        this.rollno=rollno;
      }  
     public int getRollno(){
        return rollno;
      }
     public void setName(String name){
        this.name=name;
      }
     public String getName(){
         return name;
       }
     }
     public class Encapsulation{
     public static void main(String[] args){
     Student s1=new Student();
     s1.setRollno(2);
     s1.setName("Naveen");
     System.out.println(sl.getRollno());
     System.out.println(s1.getName());
     }
   }
